# SRGAN
This repositary is created for uploading the code used for super-resolution of MRI images of pelvic region. Two datasets are used for this process - GoldAtlas MHD and Temporal data.<br />
Two different codes are being tested for this - 3D GAN superresolution and SegSRGAN. <br />
We perform various changes to the code to fit to our data and requirements.<br />
This is being done as a part of my Thesis project.
